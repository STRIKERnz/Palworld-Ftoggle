# Palworld-Ftoggle
An AHK macro that toggle holds F for all your F NEEDS!

It's set to use mouse5 as the toggle button but this can be changed to suit.
The UI x, y can also be changed to suit where ever you want it or just remove it.



The UI just adds an active/incative text down the bottom left.
